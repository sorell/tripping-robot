This is a repository containing nifty little utilities I've written to fit in
various debugging purposes. These are designed for my personal needs and their
level of configuration possibilities and documentation is not on par with well
maintained apps. However, I distribute them for free in hopes that somebody 
finds them beneficial.

Every utility is designed to be thread-safe.

memleak
-------
Memleak is a utility to keep track of memory allocation and deallocation. This
tool is written to replace dmalloc where it can not or is not feasible to use in.
Memleak comes with fewer features and a lot smaller CPU load.

runtrace
--------
Runtrace facility is for tracing your application's execution. You can place 
tracepoint creation macros in your software and print out the history any time.
This is designed for debugging application where your can't or it's not 
feasible to use printf. It is at its best in performance critical sections,
timing execution flow or tracking multithreading software. 
Runtrace is multithread safe and works in kernel and in user space.

stopwatch
---------
Stopwatch is a very simple tool for tracking time.
All code resides in one header file, which has convenience macros for 
operations.
